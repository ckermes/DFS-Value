# DFS-Value

This is a program that is designed to read in data on current player statistics, find trends in relevent categories, assign point values to what is valued in that sport (I.e baseball on draftkings or basketball on fanduel). It will then compare those values to the daily price of each player. Eventually this will also give you an optimized lineup. 


### Steps
 Read in data

 bind all player data into one sheet

 analysis on said data

 write new file and export file

 compare player file to a set of DFS values

 export dfs values sheet
